# SMS Spam Classifier using MLOps

This project implements an SMS classification model (spam vs. non-spam) using **XGBoost** and **MLOps practices** to automate the entire machine learning lifecycle.

**What is MLOps?**

MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations and refers to a set of best practices to manage the entire ML lifecycle more efficiently, from development to deployment and maintenance. It is designed to ensure that machine learning models are developed, tested, and deployed consistently and reliably.

## Features

- Optimized **XGBoost** model training.
- Automated **training, evaluation, and deployment** pipeline.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: automated testing and validation.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: seamless model updates to production.
